If you could be the founder of any company, what company would it be? Why?
	I would be the founder of AirBnB. They were one of the first big successes of peer to peer platform applications. I love the business model of connected those with supply to those with demand, and foregoing a significant portion, if not all, of the typical physical costs of a business.
What do you want to learn in this class?
	I want to learn how to think higher and bigger, and evaluating how risky something is. I love innovating but constantly find myself thinking "oh i didnt even realize you could do something that big"


LLC vs C Corp
LLC:
	More simple
	Submit Articles of organization
	Not as ideal for receiving funding (but less complicated ownership)

C Corp:
	More complicated
	Submit articles of incorporation
	Better for investing (more complicated ownership - shareholders, directors, officers)
